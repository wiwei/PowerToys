# Overview

PowerToys is a set of utilities for power users to tune and streamline their Windows experience for greater productivity.  

Inspired by the [Windows 95 era PowerToys project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerToys), this reboot provides power users with ways to squeeze more efficiency out of the Windows 10 shell and customize it for individual workflows.  A great overview of the Windows 95 PowerToys can be found [here](https://socket3.wordpress.com/2016/10/22/using-windows-95-powertoys/).

The first preview of these utilities can be installed from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/powertoys/releases).

# What's Happening

## September Update
The first preview release of the PowerToys utilities and source code is now live!  This release includes two preview quality utilities as well as the tools and docs to make it easy to create new PowerToys utilities.  

1. [FancyZones](/src/modules/fancyzones/) - FancyZones is a window manager that makes it easy to create complex window layouts and quickly position windows into those layouts.  The FancyZones backlog can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerToys/tree/master/doc/planning/FancyZonesBacklog.md)

2. [Windows key shortcut guide](/src/modules/shortcut_guide) - The shortcut guide appears when a user holds the Windows key down for more than one second and shows the available shortcuts for the current state of the desktop.  The shortcut guide backlog can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerToys/tree/master/doc/planning/ShortcutGuideBacklog.md)

Additional utilities in the pipeline are:

* Maximize to new desktop widget - The MTND widget shows a pop-up button when a user hovers over the maximize / restore button on any window.  Clicking it creates a new desktop, sends the app to that desktop and maximizes the app on the new desktop.
* [Process terminate tool](https://github.com/indierawk2k2/PowerToys-1/blob/master/specs/Terminate%20Spec.md)
* [Batch file renamer](https://github.com/indierawk2k2/PowerToys-1/blob/master/specs/File%20Classification%20Spec.md)
* [Animated gif screen recorder](https://github.com/indierawk2k2/PowerToys-1/blob/master/specs/GIF%20Maker%20Spec.md)

# Where to download PowerToys

  The latest release of PowerToys can be downloaded from https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases <br />
  Click on `Assets` to show the files available in the release and then click on `PowerToysSetup.msi` to download the PowerToys installer. <br />
  PDB symbols for the release are available in a separate zip file `PDB symbols.zip`.

# Developer Guidance

## Build Prerequisites
 * Windows 10 1803 (build 10.0.17134.0) or above in order to build and run PowerToys.
 * Visual Studio 2019 Community edition or higher, with the 'Desktop Development with C++' component and the Windows 10 SDK version 10.0.18362.0 or higher.
 
## Building the Code
 * Open `powertoys.sln` in Visual Studio, in the `Solutions Configuration` drop-down menu select `Release` or `Debug`, from the `Build` menu choose `Build Solution`.
 * The PowerToys binaries will be located in your repo under `x64\Release`.
 * If you want to copy the `PowerToys.exe` binary to a different location, you'll also need to copy the `modules` and the `svgs` folders.

## Prerequisites to Build the Installer
 * Install the [WiX Toolset Visual Studio 2019 Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobMensching.WiXToolset).
 * Install the [WiX Toolset build tools](https://wixtoolset.org/releases/).
 
## Building the .msi Installer
  * From the `installer` folder open `PowerToysSetup.sln` in Visual Studio, in the `Solutions Configuration` drop-down menu select `Release` or `Debug`, from the `Build` menu choose `Build Solution`.
  * The resulting `PowerToysSetup.msi` installer will be available in the `installer\PowerToysSetup\x64\Release\` folder.

## Debugging
  The following configuration issue only applies if the user is a member of the Administrators group.
  
  Some PowerToys modules require to run with the highest permission level if the current user is a member of the Administrators group. The highest permission level is required in order to be able to perform some actions when an elevated application (e.g. Task Manager) is in the foreground or is the target of an action. Without elevated privileges some PowerToys modules will still work but with some limitations:
 - the `FancyZones` module will be not be able to move an elevated window to a zone.
 - the `Shortcut Guide` module will not appear if the foreground window belongs to an elevated application.
 
 In order to run and debug PowerToys from Visual Studio when the user is a member of the Administrators group, Visual Studio has to be started with elevated privileges. If you want to avoid running Visual Studio with elevated privileges and don't mind the limitations described above, you can do the following: open the `runner` project properties and navigate to the `Linker -> Manifest File` settings, edit the `UAC Execution Level` property and change it from `highestAvailable (/level='highestAvailable')` to `asInvoker (/level='asInvoker')`, save the changes.

# Contributing
This project welcomes contributions and suggestions and we are excited to work with the power user community to build a set of tools for helping you get the most our of Windows.

We ask that **before you start work on a feature that you would like to contribute**, please read our [Contributor's Guide](contributing.md). We will be happy to work with you to figure out the best approach, provide guidance and mentorship throughout feature development, and help avoid any wasted or duplicate effort.

> âš  **Note**: PowerToys is still a nascent project and the team is actively working out of this repository.  We will be periodically re-structuring the code to make it easier to comprehend, navigate, build, test, and contribute to, so **DO expect significant changes to code layout on a regular basis**.

> âš  **License Info**: Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.
